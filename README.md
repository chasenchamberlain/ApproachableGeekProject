Mock up of a profile page according to the specifications given using react native

I used React Native to run this on my phone leveraging Expo, so with that comes the unfortunate bloat of installing dependencies, hope that is okay.

Make sure you have the Node 12 LTS or higher.

`node -v`

If not then install it with brew if on macOS.

`brew install node`

or visit this link for a download - [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

macOS users also need to have watchman downloaded.

`brew update`

`brew install watchman`

Install Expo CLI, this allows you to run in browser, on emulators, or through there app on your phone.

`npm install -g expo-cli`

Install the rest of the project dependencies with npm.

`npm install`

Start the project.

`expo start`

This will display a QR code which can be scanned and if you have the Expo Client app downloaded it will open it there.
Can download the app here - [Download for Android & iOS](https://expo.io/tools#client)

If an app isn't your thing then you can run it on the web with.

`expo start --web`

and then have it look more phone like with

`ctrl - shift - i` then `ctrl - shift - m`

or on mac

`cmnd - option - i` then `cmnd - option - m`

Thanks and enjoy!
